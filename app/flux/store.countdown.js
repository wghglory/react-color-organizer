/* The Store : Holds the Countdown Info 
 * Stores are objects that hold the applicationâ€™s logic and state data. 
 * Stores are similar to models in the MVC pattern, 
 * but stores are not restricted to managing data in a single object. 
 * It is possible to build Flux applications that consist of a single store that manages many different data types.
 * Current state data can be obtained from a store via properties. 
 * Everything a store needs to change state data is provided in the action. 
 * A store will handle actions by type and change their data accordingly. 
 * Once data is changed, the store will emit an event and notify any views that have subscribed to the store that their data has changed.
